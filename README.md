# Christmas Cake Project
This is a drag-and-drop clone to design a Christmas cake with fruits. It's a personal project while I learn how to code and teach English to children.

This will be heavily inspired by [this website](https://www.kumamoto-kmm.ed.jp/kyouzai/web/Original_Parfait/index.html).

## Planned Features

1. Drag and drop fruits onto a Christmas cake.
2. Change the color of the cake.
3. Enlarge and shrink fruits by using the zooming in and out.
4. When clicking on a fruit, it goes on the topmost layer of fruits.
5. Erase all fruits with a button.
6. Rotate the fruits.
7. Make a fruit disappear by dragging it back to the fruit menu.
8. Drag and drop letters.
